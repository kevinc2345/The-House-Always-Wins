      <h2>How Casinos Always Win</h2>
      <p>Whenever someone gambles, the house always has the advantage. This is due to a mathematical advantage known as the "house edge." For example, American roulette has both a 0 and 00, making the odds worse for the player. Although a bet on a single number might seem like 1 in 36, the real odds are 1 in 38 — giving the house a 5.26% edge.</p>
      <p>Slot machines are even worse. They're programmed to ensure the house profits over time, and while occasional wins occur, the system is built to make players lose gradually while keeping them hooked with flashing lights and near-misses.</p>

      <h2>Why Gambling is So Addictive</h2>
      <p>To prevent gambling addiction, we must understand its causes. Gambling websites and casinos are designed to be addictive. Online platforms use near-misses, flashy visuals, and 24/7 access to keep users engaged. Physical casinos eliminate clocks and windows, offer free drinks, and create a stimulating environment so players lose track of time and money.</p>
      <p>Many young people fall into gambling traps because they are unaware of the manipulation tactics used. Without education on the risks and mechanics of gambling, they view it as a quick way to earn money or just a game — increasing their vulnerability to addiction.</p>

      <h2>Consequences</h2>
      <p>Gambling can destroy lives. It leads to financial stress, mental illness, self-harm, and even suicide. But the damage doesn't stop there — for every one addicted gambler, at least six other people suffer the consequences: partners, children, parents, and friends.</p>
      <p>In some cases, gambling addiction becomes generational. The trauma, habits, and financial ruin are passed down, affecting future relationships and families.</p>
